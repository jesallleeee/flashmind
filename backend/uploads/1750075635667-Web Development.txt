Web Development
Last Updated : 14 May, 2025
Web development is the process of creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves everything from web design to programming and database management. Web development is generally divided into three core areas: Frontend Development, Backend Development, and Full Stack Development.

Frontend Development
Frontend development refers to everything that users see and interact with on the website. It involves the design, structure, and layout of the website and is often referred to as the ‘client side’ of an application.


Frontend Technologies
HTML: HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create and design web pages, defining their structure and layout.
CSS: Cascading Style Sheets fondly referred to as CSS is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It is used to style our website.
JavaScript: JavaScript is a scripting language used to provide a dynamic behavior to our website.
Frontend Frameworks/Libraries
React.js : A popular JavaScript library for building dynamic, component-based user interfaces.
Angular : A full-fledged framework for building single-page applications (SPAs), with features like two-way data binding and dependency injection.
Vue.js : A progressive JavaScript framework that is flexible and can be used for building both simple and complex user interfaces.
Backend Development
Backend development refers to the server side of a website, where the logic and data are processed and stored. Users do not directly interact with this part, but it ensures that the website works properly.


Server-side Programming Languages and Frameworks
PHP: PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development.
Java: Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages. It is highly scalable.
Python: Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.
Node.js: Node.js is an open source and cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside a browser.
Ruby: Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language.
C# : C# is a high-level, general-purpose programming language developed by Microsoft.

Full Stack Development
Full-stack development refers to the practice of developing both the frontend and backend of a website or web application. Full-stack developers have a deep understanding of both areas and can build end-to-end solutions.



Full Stack Technologies:
MERN Stack : MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js
MEAN Stack : MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js
JAMstack : JavaScript, APIs, Markup
Django Stack : Django, MySQL/PostgreSQL, HTML/CSS/JavaScript
Spring Boot Stack : Spring Boot, MySQL/PostgreSQL, Java
LAMP Stack : Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP
LEMP Stack : Linux, Engine-X, MySQL, PHP

Databases
In web technology, a database is a structured collection of data that is stored electronically and accessed via a web application. It serves as the backend component where data is stored, managed, and retrieved. Databases can be relational (like MySQL, PostgreSQL) using structured tables and SQL for queries, or non-relational (like MongoDB, CouchDB) which store data in flexible, document-oriented formats. They enable web applications to handle dynamic content, user data, transactions, and more by providing efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation capabilities. Database management systems (DBMS) are used to interact with the database, ensuring data integrity, security, and performance.

1. Relational Databases
A relational database stores data in tables, similar to a spreadsheet, where each table has rows and columns. The rows hold individual records, and the columns define the data attributes. Tables can be linked to each other through special keys, allowing related data to be connected.

Postgre SQL : PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database that supports advanced SQL features and complex queries. It handles structured data, ensures ACID compliance, and is known for its reliability and extensibility.
MariaDB : MariaDB is an open-source relational database that evolved from MySQL, offering improved performance, security, and features. It supports SQL queries, ACID compliance, and is highly compatible with MySQL.
MySQL : MySQL is an open-source relational database management system that uses SQL for managing structured data. It’s known for its reliability, ease of use, and performance, widely used in web applications.
2. NoSQL Databases
A NoSQL database stores data in a flexible, non-tabular format, unlike traditional relational databases. Instead of using tables with rows and columns, NoSQL databases might use documents, key-value pairs, wide-columns, or graphs to store data. This allows them to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data efficiently. They are designed to scale easily and manage big data applications.

Mongodb : MongoDB is a NoSQL database storing data in JSON-like documents. It handles unstructured data, supports powerful queries, and scales easily across servers, making it popular for flexible, scalable applications.
Cassandra : Apache Cassandra is an open-source NoSQL database that is used for handling big data. It has the capability to handle structure, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
Redis : Redis is an in-memory NoSQL database known for its speed. It supports various data structures like strings, hashes, and lists, making it ideal for caching, real-time analytics, and messaging.
